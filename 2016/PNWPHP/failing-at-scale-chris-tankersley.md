# Failing at Scale -- Tankersley

## Problems with distributed applications

- Configurations must be consistent
- Make sure your code gets updated everywhere
- Actually finding errors

You can't rely on physical log files with Docker.  Need to allow remote syslog connections

Look into installing a logging SaaS since it is easier to get set up.

Look into the ELK stack for logging.  ElasticSearch,  LogStash, Kibana

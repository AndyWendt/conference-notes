# The Accidental Professional -- Adam Culp

Life is not won by having more toys, you win life through more memories!


Contribute to other peoples lives: your family, work, etc.

People are famous because they did something, generally not because they did something extraordinary.  

Let your actoins speak louder than potato salad!

Must crawl first before you run. Example: Facebook.  Started with humble beginnings.    

If people push you to go faster, you probably need to slow down since we don't work as well when we are pushed faster. 

Learning slow is better than learning fast.  You learn, as a developer, mostly by hands-on doing. 

When you succeed at something, and people are cheering for you, of course you love it.     


Can I afford to be late, or skip out?  When you don't show up on time then you are paying others and you are not receiving a fullness of what you could. 

Avoid crunch-time: don't jump into the hay.  Learn to say "no"! 

Never forget a mistake.  Need to plan better: what will you do when you run into a bear.  

"If you don't have a plan to succeed, you will work for someone who does."    

Proper requirements gathering: buy the right motorcycle for the person by gathering the right requirements.

* Crawl before you walk
* Be responsible
* Don't over-commit
* Plan Properly
* Gather Requirements
* Learn, be open, share

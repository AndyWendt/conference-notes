### RFC process

Before you can create an RFC, you need wiki karma on wiki.php.net

Signup then email mailing lists, ask for wiki karma and then keep bugging them for it until you get the wiki karma.  

RFC process is 2 weeks.  

"They're not evaluating you, they're evaluating how your RFC will effect PHP."

Then the voting process.  

Get over your inferiority complex.  Not all RFCs pass easily but the contribution will be worthwile.  It will make people think about the system at hand.

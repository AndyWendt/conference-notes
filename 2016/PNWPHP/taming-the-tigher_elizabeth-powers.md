# Taming the Tiger

"The laws of physics apply to no matter what you are doing in computing."

Arrays are evil.  When you use arrays, you are putting data into your memory. 

 Make sure whatever data that you put into an array, is only the data that you need.  If the framework or tool you are using doesn't support that, don't use it.

# Give Me A Rest -- Amanda Folson

APIs allow you to shard off services.  

## Design

Treat your API and content similarly.  

Feedback needs to make it into the spec.     

## What is REST?

A resource is a gateway to an area of your application.  Use plural forms of entities unless it really makes sense not to.  Cart vs carts.

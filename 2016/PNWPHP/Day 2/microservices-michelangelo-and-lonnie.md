# Leveraging a distributed architecture -- Lonnie & Michelangelo

Memory issues are often an indicator of how the application was coded--not very well.   

Microservices, Docker, Async PHP

SOLID principles foundation of the microservice ideas. 

Use iterators since they will help you build better applications.

Arrays break your memory limits, use iterators instead.    

Once you get your application at a good spot memory wise, then you can scale using docker.  

Microservices are like the three musketeers: all fighting and working together for the same cause.  

Bleed awesomness, not memory -- Michelangelo.

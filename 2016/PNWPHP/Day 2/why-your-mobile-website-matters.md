More Google searches take place on mobile devices than on computers in 10 countries including the US and Japan.  

Your mobile device is your influencer.  You should think of your mobile site as an influencer.  Your customers will look at it in a store.  

The average person interfaces with their mobile phone 150 times per day.  Average 177 minutes.  

We brake down our interactions into micro moments.  Minutes on a site is gone on a mobile phone.  You only have thin slices of time on a mobile device.  How fast can you find the stores phone number?

Research mode and decision mode on same device, different times and locations.  

0 tolerance for slowness on a mobile device where it is different on a desktop, it is ok.     

Create a good mobile experience.  Consumers expect a site to load in under 2 seconds.  

Content layered over content is a no-no. 

Still plenty of 2g and 3g networks.  3g is the average speed.  Built-in 600ms to 1s latency.      

You can't dev at LAN speed for a mobile device.   

>Mobile pages that load 1s faster see up to +27% conversion rate
